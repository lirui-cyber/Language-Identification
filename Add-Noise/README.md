# Add noise for Language Identification

## Introduction to noise data set
Different channels of rats data set are used as noise, in which channel A,E,H is used as noise data of test set,
B,C,D,F,G channel is used as noise of training set.

At the same time, different SNR (5, 10, 15, 20) are used for noise addition, The smaller the SNR, the greater the noise
